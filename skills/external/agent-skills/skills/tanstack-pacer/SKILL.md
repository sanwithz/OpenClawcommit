# TanStack Pacer

## Overview

TanStack Pacer is a lightweight, type-safe library for controlling function execution timing through debouncing, throttling, rate limiting, queuing, and batching. It provides framework-agnostic core classes with dedicated React hooks at multiple abstraction levels (instance, callback, state, value).

**When to use:** Debouncing search input, throttling scroll/resize handlers, enforcing API rate limits, queuing async tasks with concurrency control, batching multiple operations into single requests.

**When NOT to use:** Simple one-off delays (use `setTimeout`), server-side rate limiting at the infrastructure level (use middleware/API gateway), complex job scheduling (use a task queue like BullMQ).

## Quick Reference

| Pattern           | API                                         | Key Points                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Debounce function | `Debouncer` / `debounce(fn, opts)`          | Waits for inactivity; no `maxWait` option by design        |
| Throttle function | `Throttler` / `throttle(fn, opts)`          | Even spacing; `leading` and `trailing` both default `true` |
| Rate limit        | `RateLimiter` / `rateLimit(fn, opts)`       | Fixed or sliding window; rejects calls over limit          |
| Queue items       | `Queuer` / `queue(fn, opts)`                | FIFO default; supports LIFO, priority, expiration          |
| Async queue       | `AsyncQueuer` / `asyncQueue(fn, opts)`      | Concurrency control, retry, error callbacks                |
| Async batch       | `AsyncBatcher` / `asyncBatch(fn, opts)`     | Collects items, processes as batch after wait/maxSize      |
| React debounce    | `useDebouncer` / `useDebouncedCallback`     | Instance hook vs simple callback hook                      |
| React throttle    | `useThrottler` / `useThrottledCallback`     | Instance hook vs simple callback hook                      |
| React rate limit  | `useRateLimiter` / `useRateLimitedCallback` | Instance hook vs simple callback hook                      |
| React queue       | `useQueuer` / `useQueuedState`              | Instance hook vs state-integrated hook                     |
| React async queue | `useAsyncQueuer` / `useAsyncQueuedState`    | Concurrency + state management                             |
| React batch       | `useBatcher` / `useAsyncBatcher`            | Sync and async batching hooks                              |
| State hooks       | `useDebouncedState`, `useThrottledState`    | Integrate with React state directly                        |
| Value hooks       | `useDebouncedValue`, `useThrottledValue`    | Create derived debounced/throttled values                  |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                 | Correct Pattern                                                              |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Using `maxWait` on Debouncer            | Debouncer has no `maxWait`; use Throttler for evenly spaced execution        |
| Creating instances inside render        | Create with hooks (`useDebouncer`, `useThrottler`) to manage lifecycle       |
| Ignoring `maybeExecute` return          | Rate limiter and throttler may reject calls; check state or use callbacks    |
| Using debounce when throttle is needed  | Debounce waits for pause; throttle guarantees max-once-per-interval          |
| Not cleaning up on unmount              | React hooks handle cleanup automatically; manual instances need `cancel()`   |
| Using Queuer when items can be dropped  | Queuers process every item; use throttle/debounce if dropping is acceptable  |
| Fixed window when sliding is needed     | Fixed windows allow bursts at boundaries; sliding window gives smoother rate |
| Forgetting `onReject` on RateLimiter    | Rejected calls are silent by default; add `onReject` for user feedback       |
| Not passing `enabled: false` to disable | All utilities support `enabled` option to temporarily disable processing     |

## Delegation

> If the `tanstack-query` skill is available, delegate data fetching and cache management tasks to it. TanStack Pacer complements Query for controlling request frequency.
> Otherwise, recommend: `npx skills add oakoss/agent-skills --skill tanstack-query`

- **Execution timing patterns**: Use this skill
- **Data fetching and caching**: Delegate to `tanstack-query`
- **Component architecture**: Delegate to framework-specific skills
