# AI Overviews Optimization

Google AI Overviews use LLMs to synthesize answers directly in search results. Visibility in these AI-generated summaries is a primary goal of content optimization.

## Scannable Answer Boxes

AI models extract information from structured, scannable text. Format content so models can identify and synthesize key points.

**Heading format:** Use H2/H3 headings that are direct questions:

```markdown
## How Does Lazy Loading Work?

**Lazy loading** defers the initialization of resources until they are needed.
It reduces initial page load time by loading images, scripts, and components
only when they enter the viewport or are triggered by user interaction.
```

**Answer pattern:** Follow the question heading with a 1-2 sentence direct answer before expanding into detail. Bold the core concept in the answer.

## Entity Extraction Optimization

AI searches for entities (people, places, things, concepts) and their relationships. Make entities explicit rather than implied.

**First paragraph rule:** Define the core entity in the first paragraph of the page. State what it is, what category it belongs to, and its primary purpose.

**Schema.org markup:** Provide a machine-readable entity map using JSON-LD:

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
  {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "Article",
    "headline": "How Lazy Loading Improves Performance",
    "author": {
      "@type": "Person",
      "name": "Jane Smith",
      "jobTitle": "Senior Performance Engineer"
    },
    "about": {
      "@type": "Thing",
      "name": "Lazy Loading",
      "description": "A design pattern that defers resource initialization"
    }
  }
</script>
```

## Topical Depth (The 360-Degree Rule)

AI Overviews favor content that covers a topic from multiple angles. A single page should address:

| Angle          | Example Heading                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Definition     | What is lazy loading?                   |
| Mechanism      | How does lazy loading work?             |
| Comparison     | Lazy loading vs eager loading           |
| Pitfalls       | Common lazy loading mistakes            |
| Implementation | Step-by-step lazy loading setup         |
| Real-world use | Lazy loading in production applications |

## Question-Based and Semantically Related Keywords

**Question keywords** target the query patterns that trigger AI Overview summaries:

- "What are the benefits of..."
- "Step-by-step guide to..."
- "How does X compare to Y..."

**Semantically related terms** are concepts that naturally co-occur in high-quality discussions of a topic. Include them without forcing:

```text
Topic: "React Server Components"
Related terms: streaming, hydration, bundle size, server-side rendering,
               client components, use server directive, RSC payload
```

## Visual Data Insights

AI Overviews can extract insights from tables, charts, and structured data.

**Data table requirement:** Include at least one data table or comparison chart per long-form article. Tables are highly extractable by AI models.

**Image alt text:** Describe the _insight_ of the image, not just its visual content:

```html
<!-- Weak: describes appearance -->
<img alt="Bar chart showing three colored bars" />

<!-- Strong: describes the insight -->
<img
  alt="Performance comparison showing lazy loading reduces LCP by 40% compared to eager loading"
/>
```

## Content Structure for AI Overview Visibility

Effective structure for AI extraction:

1. **Lead with the answer** -- first 50 words should directly answer the page's core question
2. **Use numbered lists for processes** -- AI models extract step-by-step content as featured snippets
3. **Use comparison tables** -- side-by-side format is preferred for "X vs Y" queries
4. **Keep paragraphs to 2-4 sentences** -- shorter blocks are easier for models to parse
5. **Bold key terms on first mention** -- signals term importance to extraction algorithms
