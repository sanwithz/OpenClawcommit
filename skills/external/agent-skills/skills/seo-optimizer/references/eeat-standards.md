# E-E-A-T Standards

Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trust (E-E-A-T) are the signals search engines use to separate human-quality expertise from generic content.

## Experience (The "I" Factor)

Content demonstrating first-hand experience ranks higher than abstract summaries.

**Signals to include:**

- Personal pronouns indicating direct experience: "In our testing," "I found that..."
- Unique screenshots, case study data, or proprietary research
- Specific metrics from real implementations rather than theoretical claims
- Before/after comparisons from actual projects

**Example framing:**

```markdown
## Our Migration Results

After migrating 12 production services from REST to GraphQL over 6 months,
we measured a **34% reduction in API response time** and a **22% decrease
in frontend bundle size** due to eliminated over-fetching.
```

## Expertise

Demonstrate domain knowledge through credentials and depth.

**Author bios:** Every major article should have a detailed author bio with:

- Professional credentials and current role
- Links to other published work or profiles
- Relevant experience summary (years, specializations)

**SME review labels:** High-stakes content (health, finance, legal) must be reviewed by a subject matter expert:

```markdown
_Reviewed by Dr. Sarah Chen, Board-Certified Financial Analyst, CFA.
Last reviewed: January 2026._
```

## Authoritativeness

**Pillar page strategy:** Build thorough pages (2,000+ words) that establish the site as a definitive source for a topic cluster. Each pillar page should:

- Cover the topic exhaustively from multiple angles
- Link to 5-10 supporting cluster articles
- Receive internal links back from those cluster articles
- Target the highest-volume keyword in the cluster

**Backlink quality:** Focus on citations from reputable domains in the specific industry rather than volume of links from unrelated sites.

## Trust

**Transparency signals:**

- Clearly state publishing and last-updated dates
- Cite sources of data with links
- Disclose affiliations and sponsorships
- Display contact information and organizational details

**Technical trust:**

- HTTPS with valid certificates
- Core Web Vitals within acceptable thresholds (LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, INP < 200ms). After the December 2025 core update, sites with poor vitals face steeper traffic losses in competitive queries
- Accessible design (WCAG compliance)

## AI Attribution

Transparency about AI usage is a trust signal.

**Labeling pattern:**

```markdown
_Written by [Author Name], with AI assistance for data synthesis.
All facts verified by the author._
```

**Validation requirement:** Human verification of all AI-generated facts is mandatory. AI-generated content without expert review is flagged as low-quality by E-E-A-T filters.
