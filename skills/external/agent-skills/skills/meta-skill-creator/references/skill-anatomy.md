# Skill Anatomy

## Directory Structure

A skill is a directory containing at minimum a `SKILL.md` file:

```sh
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: lean index with frontmatter + instructions
├── references/       # Optional: additional documentation loaded on demand
│   ├── basic-patterns.md
│   ├── error-handling.md
│   └── advanced-config.md
├── scripts/          # Optional: executable code agents can run
│   └── validate.py
└── assets/           # Optional: templates, images, schemas, data files
    └── config-template.json
```

## SKILL.md Required Sections

Every SKILL.md must include these sections:

### 1. YAML Frontmatter

The file must start with a `---` delimited YAML block on line 1 (no blank lines before it):

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: 'What it does. Use when X, Y, Z. Use for keyword1, keyword2.'
---
```

### 2. Overview

Two to three sentences covering what the skill does, when to use it, and optionally when NOT to use it:

```markdown
## Overview

TanStack Query is an async state manager, not a data fetching library. You provide a `queryFn` that returns a Promise; it handles caching, deduplication, and background updates.
```

### 3. Quick Reference Table

A table summarizing the most important patterns, APIs, or concepts:

```markdown
## Quick Reference

| Pattern        | API                               | Key Points            |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Basic query    | `useQuery({ queryKey, queryFn })` | Include params in key |
| Basic mutation | `useMutation({ mutationFn })`     | Invalidate on success |
```

### 4. Common Mistakes Table

A table of frequent errors paired with correct patterns:

```markdown
## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                  | Correct Pattern            |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Inline queryFn in render | Extract to stable function |
| Missing error handling   | Always check error state   |
```

### 5. Delegation

Which agents or tools to use for subtasks:

```markdown
## Delegation

- **Pattern discovery**: Use `Explore` agent
- **Code review**: Delegate to `code-reviewer` agent
```

### 6. References List

Ordered list of links to reference files with descriptive text:

```markdown
## References

- [Basic patterns and architecture](references/basic-patterns.md)
- [Error handling strategies](references/error-handling.md)
```

## Progressive Disclosure

Skills are loaded in three tiers to minimize context usage:

### Tier 1: Metadata (~100 tokens)

The `name` and `description` fields are loaded at startup for all installed skills. This is how agents decide which skill to activate for a given task.

### Tier 2: Instructions (<5000 tokens recommended)

The full `SKILL.md` body is loaded when the skill is activated. This is why SKILL.md should be a lean index -- it is loaded in full on activation. Keep it under 150 lines.

### Tier 3: Resources (as needed)

Files in `references/`, `scripts/`, and `assets/` are loaded only when required. Agents discover these files through explicit links in SKILL.md.

```text
User asks about PDFs
  → Agent scans skill descriptions (Tier 1)
  → Activates pdf-processing skill, loads SKILL.md (Tier 2)
  → Reads references/form-filling.md for the specific task (Tier 3)
```

## Size Thresholds

| File           | Target        | Warn | Max |
| -------------- | ------------- | ---- | --- |
| SKILL.md       | 100-150 lines | 400  | 500 |
| Reference file | Varies        | 400  | 500 |

When SKILL.md exceeds 150 lines, extract detailed content into reference files. When a reference file exceeds 400 lines, consider splitting it into multiple topic-scoped files.

## Reference Files

Reference files live in `references/` and follow these rules:

- **Filename**: kebab-case, topic-scoped (e.g., `mutations.md`, not `mut-optimistic-updates.md`)
- **Frontmatter**: Required `title`, `description`, and `tags` fields
- **Self-contained**: Each file includes its own code examples and context
- **No cross-references**: Reference files do not link to each other
- **One level deep**: SKILL.md links to references directly, no nested chains

Reference file frontmatter example:

```yaml
---
title: Error Handling
description: Error boundary integration, retry strategies, and fallback patterns
tags: [error-boundary, retry, fallback, throwOnError]
---
```

## Scripts Directory

Scripts in `scripts/` execute without loading source into context. Only their output consumes tokens.

Use scripts for:

- Complex validation logic that is verbose to describe in prose
- Data processing that is more reliable as tested code
- Operations that benefit from consistency across uses

In SKILL.md, instruct the agent to **run** the script (not read it):

```markdown
Run the validation script:

scripts/validate.py path/to/check
```

Scripts must:

- Be self-contained or clearly document dependencies
- Include error handling (do not punt errors to the agent)
- Be executable (`chmod +x`)

## Assets Directory

The `assets/` directory holds static resources: templates, images, schemas, and data files. These are loaded on demand when referenced from SKILL.md or reference files.

## Naming Rules

| Element          | Convention                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Skill directory  | kebab-case, min 4 chars, no abbreviations, no leading/trailing `-` |
| Frontmatter name | Must match directory name exactly                                  |
| Reference files  | kebab-case, topic-scoped                                           |

## Distribution Compatibility

When distributing via the Vercel `skills` CLI, these files are excluded during installation and must not be used for skill content:

- `README.md`
- `metadata.json`
- Files starting with `_`

## External Dependencies

If a skill requires external packages, document them clearly:

### In Description

```yaml
---
name: pdf-processing
description: Extract text, fill forms, merge PDFs. Requires pypdf and pdfplumber packages.
---
```

### In SKILL.md Body

```markdown
## Requirements

Install required packages before using this skill:

\`\`\`bash
uv pip install pypdf pdfplumber
\`\`\`

Verify installation:

\`\`\`bash
uv run python -c "import pypdf, pdfplumber; print('OK')"
\`\`\`
```

## Code Example Best Practices

### Language Specifiers (MD040)

Always specify language for fenced code blocks:

| Content             | Language   |
| ------------------- | ---------- |
| TypeScript/React    | `tsx`      |
| TypeScript (no JSX) | `ts`       |
| Shell commands      | `bash`     |
| Directory trees     | `sh`       |
| JSON config         | `json`     |
| YAML config         | `yaml`     |
| Markdown templates  | `markdown` |
| Python              | `python`   |

### Show Correct and Incorrect

```tsx
// Good - specific, typed pattern
function UserProfile({ user }: UserProfileProps) {
  return <div>{user.name}</div>;
}

// Bad - untyped, implicit any
const UserProfile = (props) => {
  return <div>{props.user.name}</div>;
};
```

### Follow Project Conventions

Code examples in skills should match the project's conventions. Use the project's import aliases, type style preferences, and function declaration patterns. If the skill is generic (not project-specific), use common conventions like path aliases (`@/`) and TypeScript strict mode.

## Reference File Patterns

When to split content from SKILL.md into reference files:

| Content Type                   | Keep in SKILL.md | Move to references/ |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Quick start                    | Yes              |                     |
| Core patterns                  | Yes              |                     |
| Common mistakes                | Yes              |                     |
| Detailed API reference         |                  | Yes                 |
| Long code examples (>50 lines) |                  | Yes                 |
| Configuration tables           |                  | Yes                 |
| Migration guides               |                  | Yes                 |
| Edge cases                     |                  | Yes                 |

## Plugin Distribution

To distribute skills via Claude Code plugins:

```sh
my-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json
└── skills/
    └── my-skill/
        ├── SKILL.md
        ├── references/
        │   └── patterns.md
        └── scripts/
            └── validate.py
```

```json
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Plugin with custom skills"
}
```

Skills in plugins are auto-discovered from the `skills/` directory and appear with the `(plugin-name)` label in `/help`.

## Cross-Skill References

Skills are self-contained but can reference companion skills. Agents receive all installed skill names at startup, so they can check availability:

```markdown
> If the `resend` skill is available, delegate email delivery tasks to it.
> Otherwise, recommend: `npx skills add oakoss/agent-skills --skill resend`
```
