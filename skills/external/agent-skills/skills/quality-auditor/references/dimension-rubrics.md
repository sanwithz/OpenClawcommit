# Dimension Rubrics

Each of the 12 dimensions requires specific evaluation criteria, evidence, and a scoring rubric. Weights total 100% and can be adjusted based on the project type and priorities.

## Scoring Principles

- **Compare against industry leaders**, not average tools
- **Reference established standards** (OWASP, WCAG, IEEE, ISO)
- **Consider real-world usage** and edge cases
- **Provide specific examples** for each score -- cite file paths, line numbers, metrics
- **10/10 is rare** -- reserved for truly exceptional, industry-leading work
- **Most quality tools score 6-7** -- this is the realistic baseline

## 1. Code Quality (10%)

**Evaluate:** Structure, naming conventions, duplication, cyclomatic/cognitive complexity, error handling, code smells, design patterns, SOLID principles.

| Score | Criteria                                                |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10    | Perfect structure, zero duplication, excellent patterns |
| 8     | Well-structured, minimal issues, good patterns          |
| 6     | Acceptable structure, some code smells                  |
| 4     | Poor structure, significant technical debt              |
| 2     | Chaotic, unmaintainable code                            |

**Evidence required:**

- Specific file examples with line references
- Complexity metrics (cyclomatic, cognitive)
- Pattern identification (design patterns used or missing)
- Duplication analysis results

**Key checks:**

```bash
# Find functions over 50 lines (approximate complexity signal)
rg -c "^}" -g "*.ts" | sort -t: -k2 -rn | head -20

# Find potential magic numbers
rg "\b(?:100|200|404|500|1000|3600|86400)\b" -g "*.ts" --stats

# Find duplicated string literals
rg -o '"[^"]{10,}"' -g "*.ts" --no-filename | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10
```

## 2. Architecture (10%)

**Evaluate:** System design, modularity, separation of concerns, scalability, dependency management, API design, data flow, coupling/cohesion, architectural patterns.

rg -c "^import" -g "*.ts" | sort -t: -k2 -rn | head -20

# Find deeply nested code (architectural complexity signal)
rg "^\s{16,}" -g "*.ts" -c | sort -t: -k2 -rn
```
